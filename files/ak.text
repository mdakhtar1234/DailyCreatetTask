Information security management is the process of protecting an organizationâ€™s data and assets against potential threats. One of the primary goals of these processes is to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Information security management may be driven both internally by corporate security policies and externally by regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
